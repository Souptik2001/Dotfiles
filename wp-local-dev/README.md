- The WordPress codebase will be present the in the folder you mentioned in the section above.
- To check where the database information is stored run `docker volume ls` and there you will find a volume with a name ending with `wordpress_db_data`. Now run `docker volume inspect <volume_name>` to find out the information about the volume. There the path of the volume will also be written.
